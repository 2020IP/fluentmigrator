h1. Code Formatting

h2. Tabs

We use the Visual Studio default for the C# code: 
* smart indentation
* tab size: 4
* indent size: 4
* insert spaces

We are aware that there is a mixture of tabs and spaces in the code, so feel free to reformat the code to this standard. But if you do so, please put it in a separate commit.

If you are making changes to the rake file (written in Ruby) then the default tab size is 2.
