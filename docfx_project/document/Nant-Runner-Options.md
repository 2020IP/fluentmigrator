The Nant task for FluentMigrator is a way to run migrations from Nant
build scripts and is very similar to the [Command Line Runner
Options](Command-Line-Runner-Options.md).

Example:

<pre>
<code>
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<project name="fluentmigrator" xmlns="http://nant.sf.net/release/0.85/nant.xsd" default="migrate">
	<loadtasks assembly="packages/FluentMigrator.1.0.2.0/tools/FluentMigrator.NAnt.dll" />

	<target name="migrate" description="Migrate the database to the latest version">
	  	<migrate
	    		database="sqlserver2008"
	    		connection="server=.\SQLEXPRESS;uid=testfm;pwd=test;Trusted_Connection=yes;database=FluentMigrator"
	    		target="./Migrations/bin/Debug/Migrations.dll"
			output="True"
	    		outputfilename="generated.sql"
		/>
	</target>
	
	<target name="migrate-rollback-all" description="Migrates the database back to original state prior to applying migrations">
	  	<migrate
	    		database="sqlserver2008"
	    		connection="server=.\SQLEXPRESS;uid=testfm;pwd=test;Trusted_Connection=yes;database=FluentMigrator"
	    		target="./Migrations/bin/Debug/Migrations.dll"
			task="rollback:all"
		/>
	</target>

</project>
</code>
</pre>

### target (required)

The assembly containing the migrations you want to execute.

### database (required)

The kind of database you are migrating against. Available choices are:
* sqlserver2000
* sqlserver2005
* sqlserver2008
* sqlserver2012
* sqlserverce
* sqlserver
* mysql
* postgres
* oracle
* sqlite
* jet

### connection (required)

The connection string to the server and database you want to execute
your migrations against.

### task (optional)

The task you want FluentMigrator to perform. Available choices are:
* `migrate:up`
* `migrate` (same as migrate:up)
* `migrate:down`
* `rollback`
* `rollback:toversion`
* `rollback:all`
* `listmigrations`

Default is ‘migrate’.

### verbose (optional)

Show the SQL statements generated and execution time in the console.
Default is false. This is a boolean switch so it can be set to `"true"`
or `"false"`.

### output (optional)

Output generated SQL to a file. Default is no output. Use
`outputFilename` to control the filename, otherwise [assemblyname].sql
is the default. This is a boolean switch so it can be set to `"true"` or
`"false"`.

### outputfilename (optional)

The name of the file to output the generated SQL to. The output option
must be included for output to be saved to the file. The file will be
placed in the same directory as the nant script was executed from.

### namespace (optional)

The namespace contains the migrations you want to run. Default is all
migrations found within the Target Assembly will be run.

### nested (optional)

Whether migrations in nested namespaces should be included. Used in
conjunction with the namespace option. This is a boolean switch so it
can be set to `"true"` or `"false"`.

### steps (optional)

The number of versions to rollback if the task is ‘rollback’. Default is
1.

### preview (optional)

Only output the SQL generated by the migration - do not execute it.
Default is false. This is a boolean switch so it can be set to `"true"`
or `"false"`.

### to (optional)

The specific version to migrate. Default is 0, which will run all
migrations.

### profile (optional)

The [profile](https://github.com/schambers/fluentmigrator/wiki/Profiles)
to run after executing migrations.

### timeout (optional)

Overrides the default SqlCommand timeout of 30 seconds.

### workingdirectory (optional)

The directory to load SQL scripts specified by migrations from.

### tags (optional)

Filters migrations to be run based on tags. See [Filter migrations run
based on Tags](Filter-migrations-run-based-on-Tags.md)

### context (optional)

A string argument that can be used in a migration. See
[ApplicationContext: Passing parameters to Migrations](ApplicationContext.md)

### transaction-per-session (optional)

The default transaction is one transaction per migration so the default
for this switch is false. Run migrations in one transaction per session
(task) instead. This is a boolean switch so it does not take a value.
